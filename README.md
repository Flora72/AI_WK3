## Theory Questions

### 1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
- **Supervised learning** uses labeled data to train models (e.g., classification, regression).
- **Unsupervised learning** finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).

### 2. What is overfitting and how can it be prevented?
- **Overfitting** occurs when a model learns noise instead of signal, performing well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
- **Prevention techniques** include:
  - Cross-validation
  - Regularization (L1/L2)
  - Dropout
  - Early stopping
  - Using more training data

### 3. What are precision, recall, and F1-score?
- **Precision**: Correct positive predictions / Total predicted positives  
- **Recall**: Correct positive predictions / Total actual positives  
- **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
